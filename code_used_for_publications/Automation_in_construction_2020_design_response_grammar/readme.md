# Code used for design response grammar pubication
This directory contains some of the code used in the following publications:

Boonstra, S., Blom, K. van der, Hofmeyer, H., and Emmerich, M. T. M. "Conceptual structural system layouts via design response grammars and evolutionary algorithms". In: Automation in Construction 116 (2020), pp. 103009. doi:10.1016/j.autcon.2019.103009

Note that the evolutionary algorithm itself is not published in this directory.
The following code is included in this directory:

* an executable that can carry out the design response grammar on a building spatial design
* an executable that can carry out the structural design of a building spatial design based on a string of design parameters

Furthermore the following supplementary data is supplied:

* the building spatial designs used for the case studies
* the settings (structural and thermal design) used for the case studies

## Reproducibility
Note that the code has been updated since the publication, and that some results may possibly not be reproduced.
The most notable change has taken place in the clustering algorithm, namely the way in which the number of clusters is determined. 
In case the reader would whish to reproduce the exact results, he/she is advised to contact an admin of the toolbox.
